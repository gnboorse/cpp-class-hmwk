Develop a polymorphic banking program using the Bank-Account hierarchy created in Exercise 2 of Written Assignment 4. For each account in the vector, allow the user to specify an amount of money to withdraw from theBank-Account using member function debit and an amount of money to deposit into the Bank-Account using member function credit. As you process each Bank-Account, determine its type. If a Bank-Account is a Savings, calculate the amount of interest owed to the Bank-Account using member function calculateInterest, then add the interest to the account balance using member function credit. After processing an account, print the updated account balance obtained by invoking base-class member function getBalance.
