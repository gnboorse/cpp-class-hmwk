##### Exercise 2 for Written Assignment 1

Write a program using a function and a series of *if…else* statements. The user should be prompted to enter a whole number in *main* in the range 1–5. The function is called and the number entered is passed to the function. This function parameter will then be used in a series of *if…else* statements to discover and print out the number word within the function (for example, 1=one, 2=two, 3=three, etc.).

**Enter a number in the range 1–5: 1**
**You entered the number one.**
