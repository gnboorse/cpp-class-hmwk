# Exercises from C++ Class

These are just some exercises I did during a C++ class and I figured I'd want to keep them for later reference whenever I end up doing C++ again.

Lots of different examples in here including basic array, function, and class definitions, but also some file I/O, custom exception handling, and class templates.

In each folder are individual READMEs describing what each assignment does.

Run `make build` to build all of the projects or run `./build.sh` in each individual directory.
