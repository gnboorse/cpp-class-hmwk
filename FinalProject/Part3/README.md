# Final Project Problem 3

Write a program that reads from the external file input.txt, counts the letters in every word, replaces
the word by that number, and then writes the numbers to an external file output.txt (Note: Do not forget
to copy the blanks. You may wish to use infile.get and outfile.put in your program.) Also you may wish
to use the strlen( ) function.
